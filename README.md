# System Programming Assignment - Patient Records Handler

## Description

This program is a system programming assignment for the university course "Îš24 System Programming". It's designed to manage patient records using custom-implemented data structures that emulate the functionality of the Standard Template Library (STL).

## Files and Modules

- main.cpp: Initializes and orchestrates the data processing workflow.
- diseaseMain.cpp: Handles disease-specific queries and operations.
- .cpp and .h files: Contain custom data structures mimicking STL components like linked lists, AVL trees, hash tables, heaps, etc.

## Project Structure

The project is structured with separate .cpp and .h files for each custom data structure and utility function, providing a learning platform for system programming and data structure implementation.
